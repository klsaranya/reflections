How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Versions:
1. Saving manual copies
2. Dropbox saves different versions of one file u save, but is saved only for 30 days.
3. Google docs: All changes saved in drive
4. Wikipedia: old verions in view history tab


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

They can be either to big or too small

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It is illogical to save unrelated files together, redundancy

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Accidental bugs can be fixed 
experiments can be done
